# EditorConfig Generator

<https://heppokofrontend.github.io/editorconfig-gen/>

This is a tool to generate the configuration file for EditorConfig.  
But normally, you will rarely need this, because it is  complement automatically by editor's features.

I created this for my personal generator creation practice.

If you use this, please read the [EditorConfig Specification](https://editorconfig-specification.readthedocs.io/).
